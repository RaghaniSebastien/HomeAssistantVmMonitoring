# HomeAssistantVmMonitoring

Stop worrying about your HomeAssistant VirtualBox VM being down when you need it the most !

HomeAssistantVmMonitoring is a little python script that checks regularly if your home assistant website is online... If not, it sends a notification, change the windows tray color to red and try to restart the virtualbox machine hosting your instance of HomeAssistant.
